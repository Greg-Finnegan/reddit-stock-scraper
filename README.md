# Reddit Stock Scraper

A Node.js-powered tool to fetch and analyze the most discussed stocks on any given subreddit.

Perfect for monitoring financial subreddits like r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, or any subreddit you choose!

- ESLint (to enforce code quality)
- Node-Fetch (for fetching the data)
- Prompt (to get user input for custom/dynamic results)
- OpenAi - experimental use of o1 mini to get stock info and sentiment
- lowDB - Simple and fast JSON database - created on runs where multiple subreddits are scanned - combines the duplicates in feed.

## Usage

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed first.

Clone the repo and and a `.env` file that has `OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'`

By default, that's it. It can do more, but that is the easiest way to get started.
